# fatripa: Fast Tripod Partition
Linear-time tripod partitions of triangulations

C++ code for the linear-time algorithm for partitioning a triangulation into tripods described in this paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08870

In product structure language, this code produces an embedding of an input triangulation G into the strong product H x P x K_3, where H is a graph of treewidth at most 3, P is a path, and K_3 is a 3-cycle.
